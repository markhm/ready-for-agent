/**
 * Production Review Lifecycle Step — reviewing pass, optional apply-findings,
 * and on changed work a nested Pre-Commit then either a Review Rerun Assessment
 * (low severity) or a mandatory full reviewing pass (medium/high). Continues the
 * Implement OpenCode Session. Reviewing uses the review model/variant; applying
 * findings, nested Pre-Commit fix turns, and rerun assessments use the build
 * model/variant. A missing or malformed reviewing/apply marker gets one
 * no-tools verdict-repair turn. An unparseable apply that changed the worktree
 * counts as a Review Fix Round and revalidates; an unparseable unchanged apply
 * is Needs Human. Nested Pre-Commit failures fail the Review Step Run (retryable),
 * same spirit as standalone Pre-Commit. At most {@link MAX_REVIEW_FIX_ROUNDS}
 * changed apply rounds; assessment and reviewing turns do not independently
 * consume rounds. Further findings without clean/deferred/cleared/accepted
 * become Needs Human (not a failed Step Run).
